Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

1-why do we need data structure?
     Data structure provides efficiency, reusability and abstraction. It plays an important
     role in enhancing the performance of a program because the main function of the program
     is to store and retrieve the user's data as fast as possible

2-What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
     * Insertion: Adding new element in the data structure
     * Deletion: It is removing data from data structure
     * Searching: It is finding location of a data in within a given data structure.
     * Sorting: It is arranging of data in some logical order.
     * Traversing: A data structure is accessing each data only once.
     * Merging: It is combining of two similar data structures.

3-List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
     * Compiler Design.
     * Operating System.
     * Database Management System
     * Statistical analysis package
     * Numerical Analysis.
     * Graphics.
     * Artificial Intelligence

4-what is an Array?
     An array is a non primitive variable  Data Structure containing a number of a same
     data type elements.
     Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable,instead of declaring
     separate variables for each value.

5-what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
     * Array is static in size that is fixed length data structure, One can not change the
      length after creating the Array object.
      ArrayList is dynamic in size . Each ArrayList object  has instance variable capacity
      which indicates the size of the ArrayList. As elements are added to an ArrayList its
      capacity grows automatically.
     * ArrayList can contain primitive and non primitive data type but array contain only
      non primitive data type
     *  Array can be multi dimensional , while ArrayList is always
     single dimensional.
     *  Array element's can be accessed  by using an index [],
     ArrayList has a set of methods to access its elements.

6-what is LinkedList?

14-what is tree in data structure?
15-what is graph in data structure?
16-what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
17-What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
18-How HashMap works in java?
19-What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
20-What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
21-What is difference between an array and a linked list?
22-What is DFS and BFS?
23-What is Recursion?
24-What are linear and non linear data Structures?
25-What is Big-(O)-notation?
26-Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?

27-Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
